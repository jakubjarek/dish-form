I wanted to go with redux-form, but the creator told me  to use react final form 🐸

Fields validation is combined of react-final-form and react-number-format, because I've had some difficulties setting it to work properly with only using react-final-form.  

**Response is displayed using alert(), please make sure you don't have it disabled 🦔**
